# password-generator

## Description
Here I have attempted to build a password generator. The motivation behind this application is to further my knowledge of programming, especially JS. The problem that the password generator solves is if a user wants a password, they can generate one with random characters, numbers, and letters. I learned that there is more that I need to learn, and that I need to practice more.

## Usage
Once this application is fully functioning, the user should be able to click the generate password button and a randomly generated password will appear in the input.
